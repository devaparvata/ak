        Revise retention periods as needed based on changes in laws, regulations, industry standards, organizational policies, or business needs.

#### 6.5 Disposal Procedures
- **Data Sanitization**: Use certified data sanitization methods to securely erase retained data from storage media, ensuring that it is irrecoverable and cannot be accessed or reconstructed by unauthorized parties.
- **Device Decommissioning**: Decommission retained devices in accordance with established procedures, including physical destruction or disposal methods that prevent data recovery and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
- **Documentation and Record Keeping**: Document all disposal activities, including details such as date, method, and verification of data sanitization or device destruction, to maintain an auditable trail and demonstrate compliance with retention policies.

Purpose:

Disposal procedures involve the secure and controlled disposal or deletion of digital evidence and associated data once its retention period has expired or its relevance to investigations has ended. The primary purpose is to ensure the proper handling and disposition of digital evidence to protect its integrity, confidentiality, and legal admissibility while mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.
Procedure:

    Disposition Decision Making:
        Assess digital evidence and associated data to determine whether its retention period has expired or its relevance to investigations has ended.
        Consult retention policies, legal requirements, and investigative needs to make informed decisions regarding the disposition of digital evidence.

    Disposal Methods:
        Identify appropriate disposal methods based on the type of digital evidence, its sensitivity, and legal or regulatory requirements.
        Common disposal methods include secure erasure, physical destruction, data shredding, and data sanitization techniques.

    Data Sanitization:
        Implement data sanitization techniques to ensure that digital evidence and associated data are securely and irreversibly erased or overwritten.
        Use industry-standard data sanitization methods, such as overwriting with random data patterns or cryptographic erasure algorithms, to prevent data recovery.

    Physical Destruction:
        Dispose of physical storage media containing digital evidence through physical destruction methods, such as shredding, degaussing, or pulverization.
        Ensure that physical destruction is carried out in a secure and controlled environment to prevent unauthorized access to residual data.

    Secure Disposal Procedures:
        Establish secure disposal procedures to govern the handling, transport, and disposal of digital evidence and associated data.

    Documentation and Recordkeeping:
        Document all disposal activities, including the date, time, method of disposal, individuals involved, and purpose of disposal.
        Maintain records of disposal activities for audit and compliance purposes, including disposal logs, certificates of destruction, and disposal reports.

    Verification and Validation:
        Verify and validate the effectiveness of disposal procedures by conducting post-disposal verification checks.
        Ensure that digital evidence and associated data have been properly disposed of and that no residual data remains on storage media or systems.

    Legal and Regulatory Compliance:
        Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements governing the disposal of digital evidence, including data privacy laws, chain of custody procedures, and rules of evidence.
        Consult with legal counsel or regulatory experts to ensure that disposal procedures align with applicable laws and regulations.

    Notification and Reporting:
        Notify relevant stakeholders, including investigative teams, legal counsel, and data custodians, of the completion of disposal activities.
        Prepare disposal reports summarizing the details of disposal activities, including disposal methods used, items disposed of, and any notable incidents or exceptions.

    Audit and Review:
        Conduct regular audits and reviews of disposal procedures to ensure ongoing compliance with retention policies and legal requirements.
        Identify any areas for improvement or corrective actions based on audit findings and recommendations.

    Training and Awareness:
        Provide training and awareness programs for personnel involved in disposal procedures, including forensic investigators, evidence custodians, and IT staff.
        Ensure that personnel are aware of their roles and responsibilities under disposal procedures and understand the importance of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

#### 6.6 Legal Hold Management
- **Legal Hold Implementation**: Implement legal holds on retained devices and data in response to litigation, regulatory investigations, or other legal proceedings, suspending any disposal or alteration activities until the hold is lifted.
- **Communication and Coordination**: Communicate legal hold requirements to relevant stakeholders, including legal counsel, compliance officers, and IT personnel, and coordinate efforts to ensure compliance with legal obligations.
- **Monitoring and Compliance**: Monitor compliance with legal hold requirements, including regular audits and reviews of retained devices and data, to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized actions that could jeopardize legal proceedings or regulatory compliance.

Purpose:

Legal Hold Management involves the process of identifying, preserving, and managing digital evidence and associated data that may be subject to a legal hold or preservation order.
